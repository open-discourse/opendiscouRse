`R` package containing functions to obtain descriptive statistics and conduct various forms of analyses using the **Open Discourse** database.

The package is currently under development, while a majority of functions are already working robustly while being tested.

Currently, the package is based on a functional approach, while the goal is to provide an additional OOP infrastructure by using `R6` object classes (currently working: `OpenDiscourse()`, currently not working: `OData()`).

One of the main advantages of using an OOP framework lies in the exclusive allocation of functions (methods). Users would be able to see all available methods, while misuse and confusions are inhibited, which should ease the usage of the package and thus make users more easily comfortable in working with the **Open Discourse** database.
